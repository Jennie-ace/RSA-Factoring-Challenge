RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptography algorithm in the world. It is also one of the most secure, with only a few known attacks that can be used to break it. but this is by design and not by accident.One of the most interesting things about RSA is that it can be used for more than just encryption. It can also be used for digital signatures and for key exchange
